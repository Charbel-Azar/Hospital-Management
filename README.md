# Hospital-Management
## Introduction
Due to the immense pressure hospitals have been facing with the pandemic, my project was targeted at creating a software using a database through web development to manage the data of a hospital. With the pandemic going on, and the situation in hospitals getting worse every minute with every new variant coming along, I thought there will be a huge need for someone to help manage the huge amount of data and patients incoming to the hospitals all over Lebanon and the world. Therefore,I decided to make my project about hospitals, where I will create a database to manage a hospitalâ€™s data. To capitalize on my skills, I decided to opt for web development where the software will run on a website. This database is intended to manage the information flow in the hospital be smooth while keep track of all the records and information of all users, materials, medicine, and equipment needed and used in the hospital.
